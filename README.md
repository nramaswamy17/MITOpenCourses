As a Computer Science major, there is a deficit of knowledge I have in the field of Mechanical Engineering.
I believe this is important if I am to become competant in the field of robotics. 

I'm following MIT's open courseware and I have listed all the pre-reqs I need to take prior to starting advanced robotics 
classes at MIT. I will document all of my course progress in this repo!
